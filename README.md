# ONLINE-GROCERY-SHOPPING-SYSTEM-
An online grocery shopping system is a digital platform that allows customers to browse, select, and purchase groceries from the comfort of their home or through a mobile device. It typically includes features such as product search, categories, cart management, secure payment options, and home delivery or store pickup services. This system streamlines the shopping process, saves time, and offers convenience, especially for busy individuals or those with mobility limitations. It also benefits sellers by expanding their market reach and improving inventory and order management.
